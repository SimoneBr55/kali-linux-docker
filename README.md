# kali-linux-docker
Kali Linux Distro running in docker.

I originally forked from Booyaabes/kali-linux-full-container but than figured that the edits I would have made were not compatible or only worked for my needs, since I wanted to add personal scripts to add some layer to it.

Since it is taiolered for my needs, I would advice against running it naively. If you want you can take a look at the code and build a docker image, but be aware that it is not meant for production and there are a lot of security concerns that I ignored...
